# Go Learning

So this will be my first time at writing some go.
Please excuse me for the ranting ðŸ˜…

## WTFs

- Why is there no bitwise OR for bools?! Please what? XOR == `a != b`, but still...
- `math.Max()` only works with floats. Of course.

## Syntax

- we constantly need to write `:=` which is annoying as hell
