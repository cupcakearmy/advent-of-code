Back to easy mode for now.

So i used the `json` parse method to parse the input. No need to write our own parser. From there recursion if your friend and if you simply implement the rules you get to part 1 quickly.

Part 2 was also straight forward. Instead of returning `True` or `False`, just return `-1, 0, 1`, add the `[[2]]` and `[[6]]` into the lines and use the built sort algorithm with your comparator from part 1 and you're done.
