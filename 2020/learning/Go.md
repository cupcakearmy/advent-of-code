# Go Learning

So this will be my first time at writing some go.
Please excuse me for the ranting ðŸ˜…

## WTFs

- Why is there no bitwise OR for bools?! Please what? XOR == `a != b`, but still...
- `math.Max()` only works with floats. Of course.
- so apparently we don't have optional parameters and defaults. Lol
- go has maps, but no native way of getting keys or values without a loop

## Syntax

- we constantly need to write `:=` which is annoying as hell
